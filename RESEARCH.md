2. **Photography heritage** - One of Ireland's most photographed pubs
3. **Traditional but renovated** - Kept traditional frontage, renovated inside
4. **Kerry/Ring of Kerry location** - Scenic route, Kenmare Bay, mountains
5. **Warmth and welcome** - Cosy, family-friendly, friendly staff

Color palette should be derived from actual exterior photos.
